        "\n",
        "### 1. **Importing Core Libraries:**\n",
        "   - **`import pandas as pd`**: Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis. It provides powerful tools for reading, cleaning, and analyzing data in tabular form.\n",
        "   - **`import numpy as np`**: NumPy is used for numerical operations and handling arrays. It is often used in machine learning for mathematical computations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Text Preprocessing Libraries:**\n",
        "   - **`import re`**: The `re` library is used for regular expressions, which helps in finding and manipulating patterns in text (e.g., removing URLs, special characters).\n",
        "   - **`import nltk`**: NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a popular library for natural language processing (NLP) tasks.\n",
        "   - **`from nltk.corpus import stopwords`**: This imports a list of common stopwords (e.g., \"the\", \"is\", \"in\") that are often removed from text to focus on meaningful words.\n",
        "   - **`from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize`**: The `word_tokenize` function is used to split text into individual tokens (words).\n",
        "   - **`from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer`**: The `WordNetLemmatizer` is used for lemmatization, which reduces words to their base form (e.g., \"running\" becomes \"run\").\n",

        "### 3. **Data Splitting and Evaluation Libraries:**\n",
        "   - **`from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split`**: This function is used to split the dataset into training and test sets.\n",
        "   - **`from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix`**: These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of a classification model:\n",
        "     - **`classification_report`** provides precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy metrics.\n",
        "     - **`confusion_matrix`** shows the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Visualization Libraries:**\n",
        "   - **`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`**: Matplotlib is a powerful library for creating visualizations such as line charts, bar charts, and scatter plots.\n",
        "   - **`import seaborn as sns`**: Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and provides more aesthetic, easy-to-use functions for statistical data visualization (e.g., heatmaps, correlation plots).\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **Keras Libraries for Neural Networks:**\n",
        "   - **`from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer`**: Tokenizer is used to convert text into sequences of tokens (numbers).\n",
        "   - **`from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences`**: This is used to ensure all sequences have the same length by adding padding to shorter sequences.\n",
        "   - **`from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential`**: Sequential is a simple model type that allows you to stack layers one by one in a linear manner.\n",
        "   - **`from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding, LSTM, Dense, Dropout`**:\n",
        "     - **`Embedding`**: The embedding layer converts words (encoded as integers) into dense vectors.\n",

        "\n",
        "### 6. **Callbacks for Early Stopping:**\n",
        "   - **`from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping`**: EarlyStopping is a callback that stops training when a monitored metric (e.g., validation loss) stops improving for a certain number of epochs, preventing overfitting and saving time.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. **Downloading NLTK Data:**\n",

        "   - **`LSTM(units=lstm_units)`**: The LSTM layer with 8 units. This is the only LSTM layer in this model, and it processes sequential input data, learning temporal relationships in the data.\n",
        "   - **`Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')`**: A dense (fully connected) output layer with a single unit. The sigmoid activation function is appropriate for binary classification, producing an output probability between 0 and 1.\n",

        "### 5. **Output:**\n",
